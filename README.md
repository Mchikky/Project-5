# Project 5 
Optimize store's data management with R or Python 

## The 3 Missions are:

1. Match an export from the ERP containing product references, their sales prices, and their stock status, with an export from a table in the CMS tool containing information on products sold online.

2. Calculate the revenue per product, as well as the total revenue generated online.

3. Perform an analysis on input errors in certain product prices to detect possible outliers, list them, and create a graphical representation for better readability.

4. Reconcile the two exports from the web and ERP.

- Insights and Recommendations

### Data Preprocessing
- Imported 3 excel worksheets. 
- Data cleaning using the following steps:
- Filled missing data with zero.
- Joined the 3 data tables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
